Emotiv EPOC Python Interface
============================

This is a BCI project using the Emotiv EPOC neuro headset.
Although Emotiv recently provided 32-bit SDK for Linux, we have chosen
to use the reverse-engineered protocol as the code will be finally deployed
on a raspberry-pi ARM box.

Parts of the project are inspired from
[mushu](https://github.com/venthur/mushu) and
[emokit](https://github.com/openyou/emokit) which is the pioneer of the
reverse-engineered protocol.
